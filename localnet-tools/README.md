## JFI Solana Localnet Tools

Automates the creation of arbitrarily complex localnet setups, including
both test validator configuration as well as account and program loading.

Provides a Rust API for defining the account data in pre-loaded accounts,
creates a JS file that allows for their easy import into a test script,
and writes a `Test.toml` that consolidates the configuration.
